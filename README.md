# 1007-Course-Projects
These are my higher level Java projects that illustrate my current knowledge of design patterns and industry coding. Currently includes a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game w/AI, a TSV Streamer/Filter, a sequence converter/data structure, and a unicycle race builder/simulation (GUI). Cannot be made public, but can be shared upon request.
